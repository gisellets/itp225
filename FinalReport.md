# Final Project: Personal Website #
For my final project, I created a personal website. At ACC, we have projects that are designed to build up to our senior capstone, so I decided to get a head start on my keystone project for junior year. My idea was to make a website all about myself, where I can eventually include things like my resume and portfolio.
The current version of my website has a pastel design. I focused on making it pink and lime green colors. I used HTML and CSS, and I’m still exploring new design ideas to improve it further. To help me learn more about HTML, I used OpenEDG’s free course. I discovered a lot of new things, including the fact that HTML doesn’t require specific indentation like Python does, which really surprised me.
On the website, I included:

- A header that says “Welcome to My Website!”
- A navigation bar with a working home link (I plan to add more links soon)
- An “About Me” section with information about who I am and my hobbies
- A picture of me (getting it to display correctly took a lot of trial and error, but I finally figured it out YAYYY)
- A footer that includes a thank-you message, a link to my repository, a goodbye note, and the HTML and CSS validators

Overall, I’m proud of what I’ve created in the last couple of classes. I’m excited to keep building on it and learning more about web development. This definitely a project I plan to work on during the summer!!
