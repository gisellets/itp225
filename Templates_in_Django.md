# Notes for "Using Templates in Django" #
- Templates: HTML files with placeholders where dynamic data is inserted.
### Why Use Templates: Makes adding dynamic data to HTML easier and keeps code clean and organized. ###

## Template Render Process ##
1. Render Data (dictionary with objects) + Template (HTML with placeholders)
2. Render Engine (a bit of code pulls everything together)
3. Rendered HTML (final HTML with data plugged in)
